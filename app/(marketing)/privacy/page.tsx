      <h2>Controller</h2>
      <p>
        Marcus Bornold, sole proprietorship trading as Saltwaves Studio,
        Oskarsparken 6, 702 12 Örebro, Sweden. Contact:{" "}
        <a href="mailto:hello@saltwaves.studio">hello@saltwaves.studio</a>
      </p>

      <h2>What we collect</h2>
      <p>
        Your email address, used to deliver the processed file, and the audio
        file you upload.
      </p>

      <h2>Free tier</h2>
      <p>
        You can upload without creating an account. Your email address and job
        details are stored temporarily in our Supabase job queue to process and
        deliver your file. Free audio uploads go directly to our own hardware.
      </p>

      <h2>Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Uploaded files are deleted after processing. Delivered files are deleted
        within 48 hours. This applies to all tiers.
      </p>

      <h2>Where processing happens</h2>
      <p>
        Audio processing runs on our own hardware within the EU. Creator,
        Studio and Founding uploads use private Supabase Storage in Frankfurt
        as temporary input storage before our hardware retrieves the file for
        processing. Completed, cancelled and expired cloud inputs are removed
        by automatic cleanup. Mastered files are served from our own hardware.
      </p>

      <h2>Paid accounts</h2>
      <p>
        Account details are stored to provide the service. Payments are handled
        by Stripe, acting as a data processor. Stripe may process data outside
        the EU under Standard Contractual Clauses.
      </p>

      <h2>Your rights under GDPR</h2>
      <p>
        Access, rectification, erasure, data portability, restriction and
        objection. Send requests to{" "}
        <a href="mailto:hello@saltwaves.studio">hello@saltwaves.studio</a>. You
        also have the right to lodge a complaint with the Swedish Authority for
        Privacy Protection (IMY).
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        We use only what is required to operate the service. No advertising or
        cross-site tracking.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Processing Agreement</h2>
      <p>
        A Data Processing Agreement under GDPR Article 28 is available to
        business customers on request.
